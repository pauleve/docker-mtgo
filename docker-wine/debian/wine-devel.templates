Description: Allow ordinary users to run applications in Wine that send/receive raw IP packets?
 Some applications need to send/receive raw IP packets, which on Linux requires
 either a privileged user or the CAP_NET_RAW capability.
 By answering yes to this question, the Wine binaries will be installed with CAP_NET_RAW 
 capability enabled. This will allow the applications that need it to function correctly,
 but is a potential security risk.
